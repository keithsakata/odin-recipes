        <h1>Onigiri Recipe</h1>
        <img src="../images/Onigiri.jpg">
        <p>Onigiri is basically a rice ball wrapped in black seaweed. It is one of the most popular snacks, sold at every supermarkt and every konbini! The most famous traditional Japanese dishes are relatively easy to make and usually contain some salt and ingredients or filings in the rice balls, such as grilled salmon, pickled plum, or spicy cod roe. When you hear the word onigiri and riceball, you might imagine a round-shaped snack, but in reality the rice balls come in all kinds of shapes and flavours. If you go to a convenience store in Japan, you will find a large selection of onigiri mostly shaped like a triangle. What’s even better is that they are reasonably priced, like many other fresh konbini snacks, making it a perfect option as your first food experience when you are visiting Japan and once you have tried some onigiri you’ll want to try to make your own at home!</p>
