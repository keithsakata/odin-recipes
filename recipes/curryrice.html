        <h1>Curry Rice Recipe</h1>
        <img src="../images/Curry-rice.jpg">
        <p>Curry Rice literally means a plate of curry and rice, and unsurprisingly the dish is generally served and enjoyed on one plate. Curry was originally introduced from India to Japan in the late 19th century, and the recipe has been adapted over centuries. The curry sauce is made with a range of ingredients such as potatoes, carrots, onions and beef. The spicy taste can easily be made with curry powder or roux sold at every supermarket. You can choose the preferred spicy level from different spicinesses, including mild ones with an almost sweet flavor which is always a favorite among little children!</p>
